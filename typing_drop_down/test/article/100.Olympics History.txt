The Olympic Games were a series of athletic competitions
among representatives of city-states and one of the
Panhellenic Games of Ancient Greece. They held in 
honor of the Zeus, and the Greeks gave them a mythological
origin. The first Olympic Games were held in 776 BC, and
they continued to be celebrated when Greece came to be 
under Roman rule.
