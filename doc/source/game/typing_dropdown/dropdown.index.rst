It's a simple game. It read the file (`words.txt <https://github.com/CarsonSlovoka/typing-game/blob/release/typing_game/test/words.txt>`_) as data to randomly generate a word.

At present, the game will only generate one word at once time, and the next word will show, if and only if typing correct of all.
